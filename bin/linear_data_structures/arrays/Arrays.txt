		
Arrays :
Array is data type of ds which store same type of data in continuous order.
 
Types of arrays :
 1. 1D Arrays ->
 operations on 1D Arrays :
 Insertion 
 Deletion
 Searching -> Binary search , Linear Search
 sorting ->bubble sort,count sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, quick sort , selection sort
 
 2. Multidimensional Arrays
 operations on Multidimensional Arrays :
 These arrays are simple matrix format arrays.
 We can perform addtion , multiplication , substraction on 2d arrays.

 
 Array Operations :
  1. Searching ->
  
 Binary Search: 
	Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing 
	the search interval in half and the correct interval to find is decided based on the 
	searched value and the mid value of the interval.
	 
	Pre-requisites to apply Binary Search Algorithm:
	For applying binary search in any data structure, the data structure must 
	satisfy the following two conditions:
		The data structure is sorted.
		Any random element of the data structure can be directly accessed 
		i.e., can be accessed in constant time.

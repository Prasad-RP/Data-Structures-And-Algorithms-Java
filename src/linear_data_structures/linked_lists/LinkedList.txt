Linked List : 
	A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.
	Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
	
	You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name 
	called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next
	portion points to NULL.
	
	Representation of Linked List :
	Each node consists:
	 1. A data item
	 2. An address of another node

Types of LL :

Singly LL
Doubly LL
Circular LL-->
	Circular LL also has two types :
	 1. Singly Circular LL
	 2. Doubly Circular LL
	 
	 Note : In Singly Linked list and Singly Circular Linked list Insertion and Deletion
	 at given position will be same.
	 
	 Note : In Doubly Linked list and Doubly Circular Linked list Insertion and Deletion
	 at given position will be same.

Applications of LL :
	Stacks and queues
	Linked allocation of files
	Graphs and Trees
	Memory management

Linked List : 
	A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.
	Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
	
	You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name 
	called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next
	portion points to NULL.
	
	Representation of Linked List :
	Each node consists:
	 1. A data item
	 2. An address of another node

Stack: 
	Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which
	the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out)
	or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is 
	inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element 
	that is inserted first, comes out last.
	
	Implementaton of stack :
		Stack can be implemented by Arrays and Linked List.
		Top is a pointer that is used to maintain stack in both type of 
		implementations. In case of array Top is an index and with linked 
		list top is pointer pointing to Top element.
		Singly LL is used to implement a stack.
	
	Top is pointer that is  used in push and pop opertions.
	When stack gets full , condition is called Stack Overflow.
	When stack gets empty , condition is called Stack Underflow.
	 
Applications of Stack :
	In Undo - Redo operations
	Function Calls- 
		The state of the program is placed into the Stack when a functionis invoked. 
	Backtracking
	Web browser history
	Reverse the Data
	Parenthesis checking
	Expression Evaluation(Infix , PostFix)

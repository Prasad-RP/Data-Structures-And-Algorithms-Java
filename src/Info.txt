what is Data Structures?
A data structure describes way to store data in memory so that computer can
perform opertaions efficiently.
Time complexity : time required to execute an algorithm.
Space compexity : total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.
Types of data Structures :

	Linear ->
		Arrays
		Linked List 
		Stack 
		Queues
	
	Non Linear ->
		Trees
		Graphs 
		
		
Arrays :
Array is data type of ds which store same type of datab in continuous order.
 
Types of arrays :
 1. 1D Arrays ->
 operations on 1D Arrays :
 Insertion 
 Deletion
 Searching -> Binary search , Linear Search
 
 2. Multidimensional Arrays
 operations on Multidimensional Arrays :
 These arrays are simple matrix format arrays.
 We can perform addtion , multiplication , substraction on 2d arrays.

what is Data Structures?
A data structure describes way to store data in memory so that computer can
perform opertaions efficiently.
Time complexity : time required to execute an algorithm.
Space compexity : total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.
Types of data Structures :

	Linear ->
		Arrays
		Linked List 
		Stack 
		Queues
	
	Non Linear ->
		Trees
		Graphs
